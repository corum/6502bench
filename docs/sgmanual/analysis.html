<h1>SourceGen: Instruction and Data Analysis</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Back to index</a></p>

<p><i>This section discusses the internal workings of SourceGen.  It is
not necessary to understand this to use the program.</i></p>

<h2 id="analysis-process">Analysis Process</h2>

<p>Analysis of the file data is a complex multi-step process.  Some
changes to the project, such as adding a code start point or
changing the CPU selection, require a full re-analysis of instructions
and data.  Other changes, such as adding or removing a label, don't
affect the code tracing and only require a re-analysis of the data areas.
And some changes, such as editing a comment, only require a refresh
of the displayed lines.</p>
<p>It should be noted that none of the analysis results are stored in
the project file.  Only user-supplied data, such as the locations of
code entry points and label definitions, is written to the file.  This
does create the possibility that two different users might get different
results when opening the same project file with different versions of
SourceGen, but these effects are expected to be minor.</p>

<p>The analyzer performs the following steps (see the <code>Analyze</code>
method in <code>DisasmProject.cs</code>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reset the symbol table.</li>
  <li>Merge platform symbols into the symbol table, loading the files
    in order.</li>
  <li>Merge project symbols into the symbol table, stomping on any
    platform symbols that conflict.</li>
  <li>Merge user label symbols into the table, stomping any previous
    entries.</li>
  <li>Run the code analyzer.  The outcome of this is an array of analysis
    attributes, or "anattribs", with one entry per byte in the file.
    The Anattrib array tracks most of the state from here on.  If we're
    doing a partial re-analysis, this step will just clone a copy of the
    Anattrib array that was made at this point in a previous run.  (The
    code analysis pass is described in more detail below.)</li>
  <li>For 65816 code, factor in data bank register changes.</li>
  <li>Apply user-specified labels to Anattribs.</li>
  <li>Apply user-specified format descriptors.  These are the instruction
    and data operand formats.</li>
  <li>Run the data analyzer.  This looks for patterns in uncategorized
    data, and connects instruction and data operands to target offsets.
    The "nearby targets" stuff is handled here.  Auto-labels are generated
    for references to internal addresses.  All of the results are
    stored in the Anattribs array.  (The data analysis pass is described in
    more detail below.)</li>
  <li>Remove hidden labels from the symbol table.  These are user-specified
    labels that have been placed on offsets that are in the middle of an
    instruction or multi-byte data item.  They can't be referenced, so we
    want to pull them out of the symbol table.  (Remember, symbolic
    operands use "weak references", so a missing symbol just means the
    operand is shown as a hex value.)</li>
  <li>Resolve references to local variables.  This sets the operand symbol
    in Anattrib so we won't try to apply platform/project symbols to
    zero-page addresses.  If we somehow ended up with a variable that has
    the same as a user label, we rename the variable.</li>
  <li>Resolve references to platform and project external symbols.
    This sets the operand symbol in Anattrib, and adds the symbol to
    the list that is displayed in .EQ directives.</li>
  <li>Generate cross-reference lists.  This is done for internal references,
    for local variables, and for any platform/project symbols that are
    referenced.</li>
  <li>If annotated auto-labels are enabled, the simple labels are
    replaced with the annotated versions here.  (This can't be done earlier
    because the fancier annotations are generated from the cross-reference
    usage data.)</li>
  <li>In a debug build, some validity checks are performed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once analysis is complete, a line-by-line display list is generated
by walking through the annotated file data.  Most of the actual text
isn't rendered until it's first needed.  For complicated multi-line items
like string operands, the formatted text must be generated to know how
many lines it will occupy, so it's done immediately and cached for re-use
on subsequent runs.</p>


<h3 id="auto-format">Automatic Formatting</h3>

<p>Every offset in the file is marked as an instruction byte, data byte, or
inline data byte.  Some offsets are also marked as the start of an instruction
or data area.  The start offsets may have a format descriptor associated
with them.</p>
<p>Format descriptors have a format (like "numeric" or
"null-terminated string") a sub-format (like "hexadecimal" or
"high ASCII"), and a length.  For
an instruction operand the length is redundant, but for a data operand it
determines the width of the numeric value or length of the string.  For
this reason, instructions do not need a format descriptor, but all
data items do.</p>
<p>Symbolic references are format descriptors with a symbol attached.
The symbol reference also specifies low/high/bank, for partial symbol
references like <code>LDA #&gt;symbol</code>.</p>
<p>Every offset marked as a start point gets its own line in the on-screen
display list.  Embedded instructions are identified internally by
looking for instruction-start offsets inside instructions.</p>

<p>The Anattrib array holds the post-analysis state for every offset,
including comments and formatting, but any changes you make in the
editors are applied to the data structures that are saved in the project
file.  After a change is made, a full or partial re-analysis is done to
fill out the Anattribs.</p>
<p>Consider a simple example:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     L1003
L1003    NOP
</pre>

<p>We haven't explicitly formatted anything yet.  The data analyzer sees
that the JMP operand is inside the file, and has no label, so it creates an
auto-label at offset +000003 and a format descriptor with a symbolic
operand reference to "L1003" at +000000.</p>
<p>Suppose we now edit the label, changing L1003 to "FOO".  This goes into
the project's "user label" list.  The analyzer is
run, and applies the new "user label" to the Anattrib array.  The
data analyzer finds the numeric reference in the JMP operand, and finds
a label at the target address, so it creates a symbolic operand reference
to "FOO".  When the display list is generated, the symbol "FOO" appears
in both places.</p>
<p>Even though the JMP operand changed from "L1003" to "FOO", the only
change actually written to the project file is the label edit.  The
contents of the Anattrib array are disposable, so it can be used to
hold auto-generated labels and "fix up" numeric references.  Labels and
format descriptors generated by SourceGen are never added to the
project file.</p>

<p>If the JMP operand were edited, a format descriptor would be added
to the user-specified descriptor list.  During the analysis pass it would
be added to the Anattrib array at offset +000000.</p>


<h3 id="undo-redo">Interaction With Undo/Redo</h3>

<p>The analysis pass always considers the current state of the user
data structures.  Whether you're adding a label or removing one, the
code runs through the same set of steps.  The advantage of this approach
is that the act of doing a thing, undoing a thing, and redoing a thing
are all handled the same way.</p>
<p>None of the editors modify the project data structures directly.  All
changes are added to a change set, which is processed by a single
"apply changes" function.  The change sets are kept in the undo/redo
buffer indefinitely.  After
the changes are made, the Anattrib array and other data structures are
regenerated.</p>

<p>Data format editing can create some tricky situations.  For example,
suppose you have 8 bytes that have been formatted as two 32-bit words:</p>

<pre>
1000: 68690074           .dd4    $74006968
1004: 65737400           .dd4    $00747365
</pre>

<p>You realize these are null-terminated strings, select both words, and
reformat them:</p>

<pre>
1000: 686900             .zstr   "hi"
1003: 74657374+          .zstr   "test"
</pre>

<p>Seems simple enough.  Under the hood, SourceGen created three changes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>At offset +000000, replace the current format descriptor (4-byte
    numeric) with a 3-byte null-terminated string descriptor.</li>
  <li>At offset +000003, add a new 5-byte null-terminated string
    descriptor.</li>
  <li>At offset +000004, remove the 4-byte numeric descriptor.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each entry in the change set has "before" and "after" states for the
format descriptor at a specific offset.  Only the state for the affected
offsets is included -- the program doesn't record the state of the full
project after each change (even with the RAM on a modern system that would
add up quickly).  When undoing a change, before and after are simply
reversed.</p>


<h2 id="code-analysis">Code Analysis</h2>

<p>The code tracer walks through the instructions, examining them to
determine where execution will proceed next.  There are five possibilities
for every instruction:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Continue.  Execution always continues at the next instruction.
    Examples: <code>LDA</code>, <code>STA</code>, <code>AND</code>,
    <code>NOP</code>.</li>
  <li>Don't continue.  The next instruction to be executed can't be
    determined from the file data (unless you're disassembling the
    system ROM around the BRK vector).
    Examples: <code>RTS</code>, <code>BRK</code>.</li>
  <li>Branch always.  The operand specifies the next instruction address.
    Examples: <code>JMP</code>, <code>BRA</code>, <code>BRL</code>.</li>
  <li>Branch sometimes.  Execution may continue at the operand address,
    or may execute the following instruction.  If we know the value of
    the flags in the processor status register, we can eliminate one
    possibility.  Examples: <code>BCC</code>, <code>BEQ</code>,
    <code>BVS</code>.</li>
  <li>Call subroutine.  Execution will continue at the operand address,
    and is expected to also continue at the following instruction.
    Examples: <code>JSR</code>, <code>JSL</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Branch targets are added to a list.  When the current run of instructions
is exhausted (i.e. a "don't continue" or "branch always" instruction is
reached), the next target is pulled off of the list.</p>

<p>The state of the processor status flags is recorded for every
instruction.  When execution proceeds to the next instruction or branches
to a new address, the flags are merged with the flags at the new
location.  If one execution path through a given address has the flags
in one state (say, the carry is clear), while another execution path
sees a different state (carry is set), the merged flag is
"indeterminate".  Indeterminate values cannot become determinate through
a merge, but can be set by an instruction.</p>

<p>There can be multiple paths to a single address.  If the analyzer
sees that an instruction has been visited before, with an identical set
of status flags, the analyzer stops pursuing that path.</p>

<p>The analyzer must always know the width of immediate load instructions
when examining 65816 code, but it's possible for the status flag values
to be indeterminate.  In such a situation, short registers are assumed.
Similarly, if the carry flag is unknown when an <code>XCE</code> is
performed, we assume a transition to emulation mode (E=1).</p>

<p>There are three ways in which code can set a flag to a definite value:</p>
<ol>
  <li>With explicit instructions, like <code>SEC</code> or
    <code>CLD</code>.</li>
  <li>With immediate-operand instructions.  <code>LDA #$00</code> sets Z=1
    and N=0.  <code>ORA #$80</code> sets Z=0 and N=1.</li>
  <li>By inference.  For example, if we see a <code>BCC</code> instruction,
    we know that the carry will be clear at the branch target address, and
    set at the following instruction.  The instruction doesn't affect the
    value of the flag, but we know what the value will be at both
    addresses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Self-modifying code can spoil any of these, possibly requiring a
status flag override to get correct disassembly.</p>

<p>The instruction that is most likely to cause problems is <code>PLP</code>,
which pulls the processor status flags off of the stack.  SourceGen
doesn't try to track stack contents, so it can't know what values may
be pulled.  In many cases the <code>PLP</code> appears not long after a
<code>PHP</code>, so SourceGen can scan backward through the file to
find the nearest <code>PHP</code>, and use the status flags from that.
In practice this doesn't work well, but the "smart" behavior can be
enabled from the project properties if desired.  Otherwise, a
<code>PLP</code> causes all flags to be set to "indeterminate", except
for the M/X flags on the 65816 which are left unmodified.</p>

<p>Some other things that the code analyzer can't recognize automatically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jumping indirectly through an address outside the file, e.g.
    storing an address in zero-page memory and jumping through it.</li>
  <li>Jumping to an address by pushing the location onto the stack,
    then executing an <code>RTS</code>.</li>
  <li>Self-modifying code, e.g. overwriting a <code>JMP</code> instruction.</li>
  <li>Addresses invoked by external code, e.g. interrupt handlers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the indirect jump targets are coming from a table of
addresses in the file.  If so, these can be formatted as addresses,
and then the target locations tagged as code entry points.</p>
<p>The 65816 adds an additional twist: some instructions combine their
operands with the Data Bank Register ("B") to form a 24-bit address.
SourceGen can't automatically determine what the register holds, so it
assumes that it's equal to the program bank register ("K"), and provides
a way to override the value.  With "Smart PLB Handling" enabled, common
patterns like <code>LDA #$E0 / PHA / PLB</code> are recognized
automatically.</p>


<h3 id="extension-scripts">Extension Scripts</h3>

<p>Extension scripts can mark data that follows a JSR, JSL, or BRK as inline
data, or change the format of nearby data or instructions.  The first
time a JSR/JSL/BRK instruction is encountered in the current analysis pass,
all loaded extension scripts that implement the appropriate interface are
offered a chance to act.</p>

<p>The first script that applies a format wins.  Attempts to re-format
instructions or data that have already been formatted will fail.  This rule
ensures that anything explicitly formatted by the user will not be
overridden by a script.</p>

<p>If code jumps into a region that is marked as inline data, the
branch will be ignored.  If an extension script tries to flag bytes
as inline data that have already been executed, the script will be
ignored.  This can lead to a race condition in the analyzer if
an extension script is doing the wrong thing.  (The race doesn't exist
with inline data tags specified by the user, because those are applied
before code analysis starts.)</p>


<h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The data analyzer performs two main tasks.  It links operands to
file offsets, and it analyzes uncategorized data.  This behavior can be
modified in the
<a href="settings.html#project-properties">project properties</a>.</p>

<p>The data target analyzer examines every instruction and data operand
to see if it's referring to an offset within the data file.  If the
target is within the file, and has a label, a format descriptor with a
weak symbolic reference to that label is added to the Anattrib array.  If
the target doesn't have a label, the analyzer will either use a nearby
label, or generate a unique label and use that.</p>
<p>While most of the "nearby label" logic can be disabled, targets that
land in the middle of an instruction are always adjusted backward to
the instruction start.  This is necessary because labels are only visible
if they're associated with the first (opcode) byte of an instruction.</p>

<p>The uncategorized data analyzer tries to find character strings and
opportunities to use the "<code>.FILL</code>" operation.  It breaks the file
into pieces where contiguous regions hold nothing but data, are not split
across address region start/end directives, are not interrupted by labels,
and do not contain anything that the user has chosen to format.  Each
region is scanned for matching patterns.  If a match is found, a format entry
is added to the Anattrib array.  Otherwise, data is added as single-byte
values.</p>
